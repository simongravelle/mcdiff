# Monte Carlo method to obtain diffusion constants (mcdiff)

Note: this is cloned version of [this repository](https://github.com/annekegh/mcdiff.git)
from An Ghysels ([annekegh](https://github.com/annekegh)) and Gerhard Hummer. Please visit their profile.

*mcdiff* is a Python program for obtaining diffusion and free energy profiles from molecular dynamics trajectories.
It uses Bayesian Analysis and Monte-Carlo importance sampling to determine those profiles and in turn calculate membrane
permeabilities via the Inhomogeneous Solubility Diffusion model.
